The first player to get four consecutive chips in any row, column, or diagonal wins! But there's a catch: When you select a column a math question will pop up and if you answer incorrectly your turn will be skipped!"

All the questions in this game were designed to be answered either from memory or with mental calculation. It's ok to use your fingers if you have to, but don't use paper and pencil! Push yourself to try new mental math strategies like \"stepping stones\" and \"factor it first\"."

This game was originally played using laminated cards hung on the wall. It was my students' enthusiastic responses that made me want to convert it to a free web app so I could share it with other teachers and students."
