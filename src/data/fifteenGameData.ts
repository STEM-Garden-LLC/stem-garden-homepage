      'A turn-based two-player strategy game. Traditionally played with a set of cards numbered one through nine, players take turns claiming one card at a time.',  'The goal is to be first to collect a set of three cards that adds up to exactly fifteen. You may collect more than three cards, but only subsets of three count as winning sets. If all nine cards are claimed with neither player making a winning set the game ends a draw.',

      'This game truly stands out for having something to offer students at a very wide range of levels of math expertise. Each round only takes takes a few minutes to play, making it ideal for a brain-break activity during class. If you want to set up a bracket and have a class-wide or school-wide championship tournament, I recommend the free tool available at Bracket HQ.',

      'The Fifteen Game is a fun way to build automaticity at mentally computing sums and differences within 20. Even for students who have mastered basic addition, trying to formulate strategies that involve offense and defense will push them. With repeated play they start to recognize patterns that make the game easier to play.', 
      'How many different ways could you win if you go first and take the 5? How many pairs are there that add up to 10? Find all the ways you could win if your opponent goes first and takes the 5. What do they have in common? Be sure to get kids talking! Thinking out loud is a valuable life skill that games like this are excellent tools for teaching. Keep playing against the bot in "Easy" mode until you win half of your games and never lose.',
