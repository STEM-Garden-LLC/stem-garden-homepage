  "Established in 2016, the STEM garden got its start as two very polluted vacant lots in New Orleans' upper ninth ward. For the first six years the garden was best described as an off-grid urban homestead. I lived there in gradually increasing comfort while working as a school teacher. Piece by piece, as I could afford materials and find the free time, I built a toolshed, an outdoor kitchen and shower, and two tiny house trailers equipped with DIY solar power and rainwater catchment systems.",
  "After removing all the broken glass, car parts, rotting couches, and other trash from the lots I began the never ending process of enriching the soil by adding organic matter. To date, I have brought in and over 400 cubic yards horse manure and yard waste. Spread over the 6000 square foot garden that amounts to a layer over 20 inches thick fresh! However, now it's fully composted, there's been no noticeable change in elevation.",
  "For the first four years the STEM Garden was totally off grid and had no monthly bills in spite of being situated in the middle of the city. In 2019, when I decided to learn web development, I got an internet connection but it wasn't until 2022 that the garden finally got a permanent connection to the electrical grid.",
  "As the STEM Garden's exciting transformation continues we are looking to build a community of gardeners and teachers and to expand our mutual-aid efforts. If you want to learn how the farm works, help facilitate our youth chess club, or use the space to offer classes to the community, please reach out! We are always accepting volunteers and are hoping to hire a part-time garden manager this summer.",
